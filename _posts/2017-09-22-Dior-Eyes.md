## BACKGROUND
Dior is a very famous House in Fashion and Perfumes, known for the exceptional craftsmanship of its fashion collections, high-end perfumes and cosmetics. To strengthen the strong emotional link with Millennials fashionistas and key clients, Dior wanted to create an outstanding experience to explore the brand content. The main objective was to trigger the interest of their consumers for the perfume and make-up categories, while expressing the modernity of the brand.

## THE BRIEF
DigitasLBi Paris had been briefed by la Maison Dior to breathe new life into the customer experience. The Labs was chosen to design and manufacture Dior Eyes, the most innovative and ergonomic virtual reality helmet in the world. Users of the Dior Eyes will enjoy 360° visits in the backstage of the fashion show or iconic Dior places.

## BRAND EXPERIENCE DESIGN
Dior Eyes is an avant-garde virtual reality helmet. Designed for men but also and especially for women. Matte, shiny, polished, leather and gold: the textures and colors are perfectly mastered and contribute to express the timeless elegance of the Dior House.

## CHALLENGES
**Design for woman :**
The headset should be used with any hair cut or any earring without any inconvenience and minimize direct contact with the skin to avoid hygiene issues.
**Built for retail :**
Dior Eyes had to work in a retail and event context meaning it should be robust and easy to setup and use.
**Fully immersive :**
Retail is a noisy environment, so the sound is a really important part of the immersion.

## SOLUTION
We have designed a completely-backless headset that require no straps that can be easily put on and off. The sound is provided by custom made directional speaker that don’t need to be in direct contact with the ear to deliver a perfect enveloping sound.
The VR experience is driven by a phone that can be simply replaced by opening the front panel and slide it into its slot.
The headset automatically detects the user: if it is worn, the content starts; if the user removes it, it pauses.
DigitasLBi Labs Paris and Dior sign here the finest combination of technological innovation and luxury design, serving entertainment in Dior Couture boutiques or in pop-up stores dedicated to home fragrancees.
